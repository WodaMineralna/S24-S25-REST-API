# Node.js Course - S24, S25 REST API

Work in progress - updated README coming soon

### Notes
This section is about REST API refactor.  
CSRF protection is currently skipped for `/api` routes to simplify local API testing. JWT auth will be implemented soon.  
MVC routes remain unchanged and still use normal CSRF handling. MVC routes will be deleted after full REST API project refactor.
